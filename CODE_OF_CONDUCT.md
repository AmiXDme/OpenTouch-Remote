# 🛡️ Code of Conduct: The Protocol

OpenTouch-Remote is an environment for high-precision engineering. We value speed, technical accuracy, and the pursuit of efficiency. This protocol ensures our system remains functional.

## 1. The Prime Directive
We are here to advance the technology. Every interaction must be a net positive for the codebase.

-   **Technical Precision**: Vague reports are noise. Be detailed, provide logs, and use the correct terminology (e.g., "WebSockets", "DPI scaling", "Capture Buffer").
-   **Knowledge Sharing**: If you have mastered a part of the stack, help others elevate their logic. We value a high-IQ community.
-   **Data-Driven Critique**: Disagreements are settled with logic, code, and benchmarks. Personal opinions are irrelevant; performance data is absolute.

## 2. System Violations
We have zero tolerance for behaviors that increase friction or introduce toxicity. The following will result in an immediate block:
-   **Harassment**: Discrimination or personal attacks. We judge people by their code, not their identity.
-   **Noise Generation**: Spam, irrelevant self-promotion, or "metoo" comments that clutter the development pipeline.
-   **Bad Faith**: Plagiarism, intentional sabotage, or misleading bug reports.

## 3. The Processors (Maintainers)
The maintainers function as the garbage collectors of the community. We reserve the right to prune any content or user that degrades the system's performance or culture.

## 4. Signal Reporting
If you witness a breach in the protocol, report it to the maintainers quietly. Do not start a public thread; handle it with the same efficiency we apply to a bug fix.

**Efficiency is the only goal. Get back to the code.**

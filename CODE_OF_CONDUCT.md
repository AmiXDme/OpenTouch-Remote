# 🛡️ Code of Conduct: The Protocol

OpenTouch-Remote is a space for high-performance engineering. We value speed, efficiency, and accurate logic. This protocol ensures our focus remains on the code.

## 1. The Directive
We are here to build. Every interaction should contribute to the advancement of the technology.

-   **Be Precise**: Vague bug reports or unclear critiques waste time. Be technical, be detailed, and be helpful.
-   **Respect the Craft**: We value developers who take the time to understand the DXGI pipeline and asynchronous flows. Help others elevate their skills.
-   **Constructive Logic**: If you disagree, prove it with benchmarks or code. Data is our common language.

## 2. Zero Tolerance
We have no room for drag on the system. The following behaviors will result in immediate disconnection from the community:
-   **Harassment**: Personal attacks, discriminatory language, or exclusionary behavior are strictly prohibited.
-   **Spamming**: Redundant issues or promotional noise that clutters the development environment.
-   **Dishonesty**: Claiming credit for work that isn't yours or deliberately submitting deceptive code.

## 3. Enforcement
The maintainers are the processors of this environment. We reserve the right to:
-   Prune comments or issues that add no technical value.
-   Block users who repeatedly violate this protocol.
-   Reject contributions that do not meet our performance and quality standards.

## 4. Reporting
If you witness a breach in the protocol, contact the maintainers directly. Do not create public noise regarding conduct violations; we will handle it with the same efficiency we apply to our code.
